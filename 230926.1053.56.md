```{topic} Aims of this document
1. Provide specific information about the Astro department's **shared Dell Evaluation Server**
    - Differences between cluster computing and server computing
    - How to access

2. Provide general information about best practices for running code on a server, for those who have access to one
    - Do's and Don't's

# Server Computing at UVA Astronomy

## Computing Terminology

````{glossary}

cluster
    A set of interlinked computers that function as a single system.

    ![](img/231002.1151.50.png)

    - Splits access into a "head node" and "compute nodes"
        - Head node is used for user login, basic navigation, code setup
        - Compute nodes are used for massively parallel jobs
    - Has some way to submit job scripts, which are automatically sorted into a queue based on computing demand

server
    A single computer accessible to many users, typically via SSH connection.

    ![](img/231002.1147.41.png)

    - Does not generally have a queue or batch submission process
    - Typically has a large number of computing cores
    - Does not have a head node or compute nodes
        - User login and computational work are both performed by the same computer

## Shared "Dell Evaluation" Server

A computing resource purchased with departmental ETF funds. **It is intended for heavy-compute users in the Astronomy department.**

The server computer has 128 CPU cores, and *only a couple hundred GB of shared storage space.* It is intended for computation, not storage!

### How to Access

Try the following from a command line:

```{code} bash
ssh your_computing_id@delleval-gb1.astro.virginia.edu
```

- If you're prompted for a password, try logging in with your UVA credentials. It is likely Pete has already set up an account for you.
- If you get an error message or cannot log in, email Pete and ask for an account to be set up for you on the Dell server. Pete's email: pbn9j@virginia.edu


### When should I use this?

![](img/231009.0926.43.png)

Other use-cases:

- Your laptop doesn't have enough memory to hold a large dataset in RAM simultaneously

## Etiquette

```{admonition} DANGER
:class: danger

**Usage of this server is completely unregulated. Anyone can use any amount of cores for any amount of time, without consequence. As a communal resource, it is susceptible to *Tragedy of the Commons*.**
```

- Run parallel jobs on the server that would otherwise overwhelm your laptop (or your department-issued desktop).
- Check the current utilization of the server's cores with `htop` before starting a new job
- **Have an estimate for how long a job should run before starting it.**
    - Limit your core utilization proportionally to how long your job is expected to run
      ```{admonition} Good
      :class: tip
      - Few cores for a long time
      - Many cores for a short time
      ```

      ```{admonition} Unnecessary
      :class: warning
      - Few cores for a short time
      ```

      ```{admonition} Bad
      :class: error
      - Many cores for a long time
      ```

- Clean up suspended jobs
    - Check your current jobs with

      ```{code} bash
      top -u your_username
      ```

      - Kill some job with PID "2974" by issuing the command `kill 2974`
      - Kill all jobs started by a program "zoom" by issuing the command `killall -u your_username zoom`
      - Kill a stubborn process called "athena" that won't be killed with a regular kill signal by issuing the command `killall -u your_username -9 athena`

      ```{danger}
      The `-u your_username` option here is **crucial** for `killall`. This specifies that you only want to kill processes with that name which *you* started. Otherwise, *all processes on the machine sharing that name will be killed*, regardless of who started them.
      ```
- Transfer your data to your personal machine as soon as your job is completed.

## Common pitfalls

### Missing modules

```{admonition} Why isn't my code running? Nothing seems to be installed on this computer!
:class: danger
- Compilers and executables may depend upon packages that are not loaded by default on a server or computing cluster.
```

`````{admonition} You may have forgotten to load modules.
:class: hint
- Both {term}`server`s and {term}`cluster`s typically use modulefiles to manage packages like OpenMPI, HDF5, etc.

````{glossary}
module
    A collection of libraries or packages that may be loaded by the user prior to computing.

    - Allows the user to manage and resolve package conflicts rather than the administrator
    - Administrator manages all modules, user may submit requests
    - Modules are typically several years to decades out-of-date, to preserve cross-compatibility

    Common commands:
     - ```{code} bash
       # List all available modules
       module avail
       ```
     - ```{code} bash
       # Unload all currently-loaded modules
       module purge
       ```
     - ```{code} bash
        # List all currently-loaded modules
        module list
        ```
     - ```{code} bash
        # Load the module `some-module`
        module load some-module
        ```
````
`````

### Killed jobs

```{admonition} I left everything running but my job was still killed.
:class: danger
- Idle terminals will have their SSH connection closed.
- If your job is attached to that terminal, your job will be killed or suspended.
```

```{admonition} Solution: use screen or tmux to start your job in a detatched terminal session.
:class: hint
- `screen`: comes by default on every system
- `tmux`: more modern and streamlined, but unlikely to be installed by default on older systems. Can be installed locally without root access.
```

### Trouble with `$PATH` or `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

```{admonition} My environment variables are being set inconsistently.
:class: danger
- `~/.bashrc` is loaded on terminal initialization.
- `~/.bash_profile` is loaded on login shells.
    - `tmux` starts a *login shell* by default and will source this file. If there are conflicts between `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.bashrc`, the former will overwrite the latter.
```

````{admonition} Tip
:class: hint

When in doubt, do

```{code} bash
echo $PATH
```
or whichever environment variable you are trying to set. This can still be tricky to debug sometimes---just be mindful of exactly where and how you're setting each of your environment variables.
