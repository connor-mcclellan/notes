# basic `bash` scripting

```{admonition} Work in Progress
:class: warning
These notes are under construction for a future presentation and are only a rough draft at this point.
```


It takes a lot of time to type out repetitive commands and search through your history every time you want to repeat something you've done before. It can be helpful to organize your research directories with `exec.sh`, `run.sh`, or `plot.sh` scripts, which perform a certain repeatable part of your analysis.

```{danger}
**As a rule, never put `rm` commands in bash scripts.**

If you misplace a wildcard (`*`) or an earlier command fails, putting you in the wrong directory when you `rm -r ./*`, you could quite literally delete your entire computer.

Design your `bash` scripts to handle *a single task* of file I/O, and leave the garbage collection to the user afterwards. Be cautious of `.sh` scripts growing too large and trying to do too much at once.
```

## Simple example

Simple bash scripting can be accomplished just by putting a series of `bash` commands into a `.sh` file, separated by newlines.

```{code} bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir "./run/eddingtonwind_test"
cd "./run/eddingtonwind_test"
mpirun -np 4 ./athena-multigroup/bin/athena -i ./run/athinput.eddingtonwind >> log.out
```

Then you can run this script with

```{code} bash
# Execute the script exec.sh in bash
bash exec.sh
```

Alternatively, you could tell your computer it can actually run this text file as an executable. Just change the permissions accordingly:

```{code} bash
# Add execute permission to the file exec.sh
chmod +x exec.sh
```

Then run your script with

```{code} bash
# Execute the script exec.sh in bash
./exec.sh
```

## Intermediate example: Adding variables

Variables are declared with equals signs and accessed with dollar signs. Be mindful that bash doesn't like whitespace---keep whitespace out of your variable declarations!

Here's a more advanced example:

```{code} bash
#!/bin/bash

athinput="./run/athinput.eddingtonwind"
problem_id=`cat $athinput | head -7 | tail -1`
basename=`grep -oP '(?<==\ ).*?(?=\ #)' <<< "$problem_id"`

mkdir "/PellaShared/bcm2vn/Documents/athena-multigroup/run/$basename"
cd "./$basename"

filename="/PellaShared/bcm2vn/Documents/athena-multigroup/run/$basename/$basename.txt"
cat /PellaShared/bcm2vn/Documents/athena-multigroup/run/athinput.eddingtonwind >> $filename

mpirun -np 4 /PellaShared/bcm2vn/Documents/athena-multigroup/bin/athena -i /PellaShared/bcm2vn/Documents/athena-multigroup/run/athinput.eddingtonwind >> $filename
```

## Advanced example: Conditionals

It's best practice to have your execution script halt if one of your commands doesn't execute sucessfully. The syntax becomes a little messy, but this is technically the most careful way of bash scripting so you don't do unneccessary work or accidentally end up deleting something.

```{code} bash
#!/bin/bash
source ENVARS

# Note: lowercase bash variables are defined here
#       UPPERCASE bash variables are defined in scripts/ENVARS

pushd $BASEDIR
timestamp=$(date +%y%m%d.%H%M.%S)
datadir="$BASEDIR/data/$timestamp"
if mkdir $datadir ; then
  printf "${BOLD}[run.sh]${NC} ${COLOR}Created directory $datadir${NC}\n"
else
  popd
  exit 1
fi

if python scripts/athinput.py --gz; then
  mv $BASEDIR/scripts/athinput.eddingtonwind $datadir
  printf "${BOLD}[run.sh]${NC} ${COLOR}Created athinput file $datadir/athinput.eddingtonwind${NC}\n"
else
  popd
  exit 1
fi

printf "${BOLD}[run.sh]${NC} ${COLOR}Running code...${NC}\n"
athinput="$datadir/athinput.eddingtonwind"
if mpirun -np 1 athena/bin/athena -i $athinput -d $datadir ; then
  mv $BASEDIR/Rad_angles.txt $datadir
else
  popd
  exit 1
fi

popd
```
